8. Uber Insights from City Supply and Demand Data
DailyUber provides the 2016 data. By using this data find out the demand and supply Analysis gap of the cab. The main objective of this project is to analyze the data on Uber Request data. Through the analysis of data, we can find some important insights.
App Openings (Eyeballs) = Customers who launch the app looking for riders. It is a good measure of demand
Zeroes = Customers who open the app and see no cars in the area. 
Request = Customers who make requests for a car. 


 Using the provided dataset, answer the following questions:
Which date had the most completed trips during the two weeks?
To find the date with the most completed trips, you can group the data by date and sum the completed trips column. Then, sort the results in descending order and select the top row.

What was the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period?
To find the highest number of completed trips within a 24-hour period, you can group the data by date and use a window function to sum the completed trips column over a rolling 24-hour period. Then, you can sort the results in descending order and select the top row.

Which hour of the day had the most requests during the two-week period?
To answer this question, we need to group the data by an hour and sum the "Requests" column for each hour. We can then sort the result by the sum of requests and select the hour with the highest sum.


What percentages of all zeroes during the two week period occurred on weekends (Friday at 5 pm to Sunday at 3 am)? 
Tip: The local time value is the start of the hour (e.g. 15 is the hour from 3:00pm - 4:00pm)
To answer this question, we need to filter the data to select only the rows that fall within the specified time range, count the total number of zeros, and count the number of zeros that occurred on weekends. We can then calculate the percentage of zeros that occurred on weekends.

What is the weighted average ratio of completed trips per driver during the two week period? 
Tip: "Weighted average" means your answer should account for the total trip volume in each hour to determine the most accurate number in the whole period.
To answer this question, we need to calculate the ratio of completed trips to unique drivers for each hour, multiply the ratio by the total number of completed trips for that hour, and then sum the results. We can then divide this sum by the total number of completed trips for the entire period.


In drafting a driver schedule in terms of 8 hour shifts, when are the busiest 8 consecutive hours over the two week period in terms of unique requests? A new shift starts every 8 hours. Assume that a driver will work the same shift each day.
To solve this, we can first calculate the number of unique requests for each hour of the day, and then slide a window of 8 hours across the hours to find the 8 consecutive hours with the highest number of unique requests.

True or False: Driver supply always increases when demand increases during the two week period. 
Tip: Visualise the data to confirm your answer if needed.
This statement is false. There are multiple reasons why driver supply might not always increase when demand increases. For example, some drivers might choose not to work during peak demand times, or there might be external factors that affect driver availability (such as traffic, weather conditions, or events in the city). To confirm this, we would need to analyze the data and identify instances where demand increased but driver supply did not.

In which 72 hour period is the ratio of Zeroes to Eyeballs the highest?
To answer this question, we can group the data by 72-hour periods and calculate the ratio of zeroes to eyeballs for each period. We can then find the period with the highest ratio.

If you could add 5 drivers to any single hour of every day during the two week period, which hour should you add them to? 
Hint: Consider both rider eyeballs and driver supply when choosing
To determine which hour to add 5 drivers too, we want to look for an hour where there are a high number of rider eyeballs and a low number of unique drivers. One way to approach this is to calculate the ratio of requests to unique drivers for each hour and then choose the hour with the highest ratio. The idea here is that adding more drivers to an hour with a high ratio will result in more completed trips

True or False: There is exactly two weeks of data in this analysis
Looking at the data from all two weeks, which time might make the most sense to consider a true "end day" instead of midnight? (i.e when are supply and demand at both their natural minimums) 
Tip: Visualise the data to confirm your answer if needed.
One way to approach this question is to calculate the average number of completed trips and unique drivers for each hour of the day over the entire two-week period. We can then look for the hour with the lowest number of completed trips and unique drivers to find the time when supply and demand are at their natural minimums.

Standard deviation is a statistical term that measures the amount of variability or dispersion around an average. Standard deviation is also a measure of volatility: using Numpy is easy to calculate it for each stock or sector into Index.
With SD, we could calculate the coefficient of variation (CV=standard deviation/mean). As a rule of thumb, a CV >= 1 indicates a relatively high variation, while a CV < 1 can be considered low. This means that distributions with a coefficient of variation higher than 1 are considered to be high variance whereas those with a CV lower than 1 are considered to be low variance.

Customer Personality Analysis is a detailed analysis of a company’s ideal customers. It helps a business to understand its customers better. It makes it easier for them to modify products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers.

Customer personality analysis helps a business modify its product based on its target customers from different types of customer segments. For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s database, a company can analyze which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then market the product only on that particular segment.
